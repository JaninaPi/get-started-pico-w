## What next?

If you have a look at [Introduction to Raspberry Pi Pico: LEDs, buzzers, switches, and dials](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/pico-intro), you can find plenty of ideas for how to improve on your Raspberry Pi Pico web server.

In the [LED firefly](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/led-firefly) you can learn how to wire up external LEDs to Raspberry Pi Pico, then you could use a web interface to change the pattern your firefly blinks with.

In the [Party popper](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/party-popper) project you can learn how to use a switch to control an RGB LED and a buzzer. You could use a web form with this project to control the colour of the LED and the tone that the buzzer plays.

In [Beating heart](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/beating-heart) you learn to use a potentiometer to control a pulsing LED, but you could also use your browser to control the pulse rate, and the potentiometer could be used to change the appearance of your web page.
